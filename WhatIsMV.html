        <h1>What is Metaverse and How Does It Work?</h1>
        <p>
            “Metaverse” the term was first introduced in 1992 in Snow Crash, a Neil Stephenson sci-fi novel that put
            forward the beginning of a unique advanced reality where the actual world has become inhabitable and the
            final exit is through Virtual Reality.

            The metaverse is an undeniably complicated idea in the digital world, ensures an outstanding opportunities
            for billions of individuals. The accurate meaning of the metaverse is still laid out by current pioneers. Be
            that as it may, a great number of people allude to “metaverse” as a new internet insight, which works around
            various special technologies.

            As per Mark Zuckerberg, one of the market chiefs investing huge resources into the metaverse idea, it is a
            sort of “embodied internet”. It’s something you can bounce into (through VR) or bring to your real world
            (through AR).

            To go somewhat more profound, the metaverse offers a future where we can relish a more grounded cross
            between our physical and digitally advanced lives. Analyze how the LiDAR scanner on the new iPhone can
            examine your environment and introduce new substances into them through your camera. Or on the other hand
            consider how you can now put resources into digital art form utilizing NFTs. These are examples of the
            metaverse technology.

        <h1>Characteristics of Metaverse</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Interactivity</li>
            <p>
                The Metaverse innovation would comprise a transaction between both AR and VR technology. A Metaverse
                application relied upon to have a similarity to space and time like to the real world. Interaction in
                the actual world could be visible, dynamic in nature, and auditory. A Metaverse stage relied upon to
                convey experiences on similar lines for digital collaboration.
            </p>
            <li>Interoperable</li>
            <p>
                A Metaverse application ought to be interoperable between at least one or more Metaverse platform(s).

                The Metaverse application development focuses on a varied range of technologies that still need to be
                tested. Relying on who is developing it. It could be a Metaverse startup or a legacy fat cat, its
                arrangements could go from restricting to open-ended experiences, and changeable ones. Likewise, there
                is no limitation of toolkits which are sent to show the future reality into existence. Such developer
                toolkits contain the Unreal Engine, Amazon’s Sumerian, Unity, Maya, and Blender,.
